# Pages Of History
Genelogical documents relating to the Page family, from Blackheath, West Midlands

## Background
I started researching the Hingley Family tree back in 2012, and soon discovered that an Auntie (Barbara) had already done some research back in the 1980's  

She had collated her findings into a folder which contained not only genelogical information, but also relevant geographical information about the towns that the family lived in.  The family in question (My grandmother's family) is the Page family, and the town in question is Blackheath in the West Midlands - UK.


Folder was split into sections, and these are being scanned in and OCR'd where possible.

## Structure
The Original folder, contains the original scans of sections of Barbara's folder - these are typically PDF files.  The digitised versions can be found in the Updated Folder.
